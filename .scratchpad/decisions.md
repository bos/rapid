# Design Decisions

Non-obvious choices where "why did we do it this way?" isn't captured in the code.

## Web content security

- **Use explicit strict sanitization at known trust boundaries plus browser enforcement as defense in depth.** External QA content, notes, remote metadata, Markdown, and reusable HTML widgets pass through Rapid's narrow DOMPurify allowlist. Trusted Types additionally routes legacy HTML sinks through DOMPurify's standard allowlist, but does not replace the explicit checks.
- **Keep CSP inline scripts hash-based.** Rapid's existing bootstrap remains inline, but `script-src` has no `unsafe-inline`; exact SHA-256 hashes authorize it. The predeploy step refreshes hashes after embedding build data, and `check:csp` catches stale committed policies.
- **Restrict the Trusted Types default policy rather than making it a bypass.** HTML is sanitized; dynamic script URLs are limited to same-origin resources and Browser-Update's two known loader paths; dynamic script bodies have no policy. An embedding page's pre-existing default policy remains in control.

## Pixi World-Coord Rendering (render_worldcoord)

- **Scene graph hierarchy**: `stage → origin → world → groups → features`. `stage` centers [0,0] at screen center for rotation. `origin` shifts back to top-left and absorbs panning offset (via Pixi's own `x/y`). `world` maps z16 world coordinates to screen pixels via `world.scale = 2^(pixiTransform.z - WORLD_ZOOM)` and `world.position = (pixiTransform.x - WORLD_HALF * scale, pixiTransform.y - WORLD_HALF * scale)`. All layers that render entity geometry live under `world`.
- **Use `pixiTransform` not `mapTransform` for `world`** — Panning is absorbed by the `origin` container. `pixiTransform` already includes all pending panning deltas. `mapTransform` lags behind by one frame during drags. Using `pixiTransform` means small panning moves don't dirty `world` at all.
- **`background` (tile imagery) stays under `origin`** — Tile textures are in screen space; there is no benefit to putting them under `world`. Only entity-geometry layers move.
- **Container position = `world.origin` (extent center)** — Each feature's `container.position` is set to the extent center of its geometry in z16 world coordinates. All vertex drawing is then origin-relative. This keeps vertex magnitudes small (~thousands not ~8 million), making float32 drawing safe and d3-polygon numerics stable.
- **Points: counter-scale + counter-rotate** — The `world` container scales geometry up with zoom. Point sprites are fixed-size in screen pixels. Fix: set `container.scale = baseScale / worldScale` and `container.rotation = -bearing`. This keeps child sprites screen-sized regardless of zoom/bearing. Halos and hit areas live in the counter-scaled local space, so they work unchanged.
- **Lines + polygons: world-local stroke widths** — Instead of counter-scaling (which would shrink geometry), express stroke widths in world-local units: `localWidth = pixelWidth * 2^(WORLD_ZOOM - zoom)`. At render time the `world` container's scale inverts this back to screen pixels. Dash patterns and buffer widths use the same conversion.
- **Hit areas are in container-local space** — `container.hitArea = new PIXI.Polygon(...)` coordinates must be in the container's local frame. For world-path features the local frame is world-local (origin-relative). `lineToPoly()` is called with world-local points and a world-local buffer width. Pixi composes the container transform when doing hit testing, so no extra projection is needed.
- **DashLine halos: `scale` only, no per-caller workaround** — DashLine's `scale` option multiplies `width` and each `dash[i]` to convert drawing-coord units to screen pixels. Line/Polygon halo containers have `scale=1` (drawing in world units), so they pass `scale: 2^(WORLD_ZOOM - zoom)` (a.k.a. `localScale`) to keep dashes at fixed screen-pixel sizes. Point halo containers have a counter-scale (`1/worldScale`) that puts halo-local units in CSS pixels, so `scale=1` (default) is correct. DashLine itself uses `textureSpace: 'global'` (normalizes UV by texture pixel dimensions, no per-segment stretch), keeps pow2 padding for WebGL1 REPEAT-wrap, and compensates in the per-segment matrix using `texW`/`texH` instance fields so one full cycle covers exactly `dashSize * userScale` local units. Matrix composed scale-then-rotate for non-uniform scale correctness.
- **`viewZoom` vs `styleZoom` naming convention** — Throughout the Pixi layer and feature files: `viewZoom = viewport.transform.zoom` is used for scale chain math (world↔screen scale factors, `worldScale = 2^(viewZoom - WORLD_ZOOM)`). `styleZoom = map?.effectiveZoom() ?? viewZoom` is the latitude-adjusted zoom used only for LOD thresholds (`< 16`, `< 17`) and styling decisions. The two are explicitly named at the top of each method that needs both. `PixiFeaturePolygon` has no LOD thresholds so it only has `viewZoom` — intentional.
- **`MapSystem.effectiveZoom()` formula** — `z + (-log2(cos(lat * DEG2RAD)))`. The old implementation used two `geoMetersToLon(1, lat)` / `geoMetersToLon(1, 0)` calls whose ratio is exactly `1/cos(lat)`, i.e. `sec(lat)`. The direct formula is equivalent but avoids the detour through longitude-scale math.
- **Dual-path migration pattern**: `_geom !== null` → world path; else legacy screen path. Branch on `if (this._geom)` in feature `update()`. Legacy `geom` (PixiGeometryPart) is kept alive until all callers migrate. Final cleanup (Step 5) removes `geom`, `PixiGeometryPart`, all `setCoords` calls, and merges both paths.

## World Coordinate System (render_worldcoord)

- **Use SDK-native z16 world coordinates as the canonical world space** — We removed Rapid's temporary `worldScaled` bridge and now rely on `@rapid-sdk/math` world coordinates directly (`WORLD_ZOOM = 16`, world range `0..16,777,216`). This avoids duplicate geometry caches and keeps rendering/spatial math aligned with SDK primitives.
- **Keep world-coordinate grouping in PixiScene** — Feature groups continue using a single zoom-dependent group transform (`scale = 2^(zoom - WORLD_ZOOM)`) so features can stay in world-coordinate local geometry without per-vertex reprojection each frame.

## World Coordinate Numerics

- **World coordinates are safe for affine transforms, risky for shoelace-style derived metrics** — Rotation, translation, scaling in world space work correctly. But d3-polygon's centroid/area formulas involve cross-products (x₀*y₁ - x₁*y₀) where the products are ~1e13 and their differences are ~1e7, leading to catastrophic cancellation when accumulating ~1e14-magnitude terms. The final centroid can land far outside the polygon's hull.
- **Compute d3-polygon metrics in a local translated frame** — For centroid and area, translate all points by subtracting the extent center (world.origin), compute the metric locally, then translate the result back. This keeps intermediate values small (~1e-6) and preserves precision. Example: centroid in world space landed outside the hull; same computation on translated points (offset by `world.origin`) placed centroid correctly inside.
- **GeometryPart caches `.local` coordinates for numerical stability** — Each GeometryPart now stores three coordinate frames: (1) `.orig` in WGS84, (2) `.world` in z16 world coordinates, (3) `.local` relative to world origin. All d3-polygon computations (hull, centroid, area, ssr) happen on `.local` coordinates, then results are translated back to world space. This eliminates the need for the `stablePolygonCentroid()` workaround and enables future Pixi rendering optimization: local arrays can be rendered directly with Pixi container transforms (position at origin, no per-vertex reprojection).
- **Hull and geometric tests are robust** — `polygonHull()` and orientation tests (like `cross(a,b,c)`) work correctly on large coordinates because they compare point membership (combinatorial) rather than accumulating cancelling terms.
- **Area drifts less than centroid** — In a test case (0.00456% drift for area vs. >100% for centroid), but both use local frame for consistency and to avoid future surprises.
- **References:** See [modules/lib/GeometryPart.ts](modules/lib/GeometryPart.ts) local frame computation and [test/unit/lib/GeometryPart.test.js](test/unit/lib/GeometryPart.test.js) tests for local/world coordinate correctness.

## Spatial System — buffers / conflation (Step 3)

- **Buffers are quantized "coverage boxes", not exact geometry** — A mathematically exact buffer is the Minkowski sum of a geometry with a disk. We don't need exactness, we need speed. Turf/JTS don't compute Minkowski either (they offset-curve + node + polygonize; same family as `PIXI.buildLine` / `lineToPoly`). For conflation we cover the geometry in boxes (a quantization). Coverage boxes double as the RBush query boxes.
- **`geomCoverageBoxes` is for conflation, not rope labels** — Rope labels need a *uniform arc-length sampler* (`geomLineSegments`) so that `scaleX = lWidth / ((numBoxes-1)*boxsize)` holds. `geomCoverageBoxes` subdivides each segment independently and produces denser, non-uniform spacing, which breaks `scaleX` and squishes text. The two helpers serve different purposes despite both "sampling along a line".
- **Coverage representation is per geometry type** — Point → one box of half-size `r`; LineString → boxes sampled every ~`r` along the line (partial matching falls out for free, per-box); Polygon → grown extent box (box-filling a 2D region is wasteful; phase-2 uses real polygon overlap instead). Don't force everything into box-fills.
- **Radius is a recompute parameter, not baked into `setData`** — `setData()` computes the radius-independent core projection; a separate `computeCoverage(r)` produces coverage for a given radius and is re-called when the user tweaks the conflation distance (e.g. 3 m → 2.5 m).
- **Two-phase querying with a caller-supplied predicate** — RBush indexes bboxes only, so queries are bbox-prefilter then precise-refine. `SpatialSystem` owns the generic mechanics (`getItemsAtBox(es)`, refine) but takes the predicate from the caller; "match" semantics live in a `Conflation` module. Phase-2 predicates already exist in `@rapid-sdk/math` (`geomPointInPolygon`, `geomPolygon{Contains,Intersects}Polygon`, `geomLineIntersection`, `vecProject`/`vecLength`), so we almost certainly never need `jsts`. New helpers can start in `modules/geo` and migrate to the SDK later (we control `rapid-sdk`).
- **Lazy `GeometryPart` derived products (Step 3a)** — `update()` keeps only the cheap core eager (projected coords, extent, origin, outer); `hull`/`centroid`/`poi`/`area`/`winding`/`surround`/`flat` are lazy memoized getters computed on first access. This shrinks the memory/compute footprint for large datasets (Overture-scale) where most features are never rendered or conflated. Because `centroid`/`poi` derive from `hull` (stabilization trick), they share the same laziness. `clone()` re-derives from `orig` (cheap now) rather than deep-copying computed arrays, which also avoids the lazy-getter-vs-`structuredClone` interaction.

## actionMove: frame-of-reference in `replaceMovedVertex`

`replaceMovedVertex` does two tests when deciding whether to insert a shape-preserving vertex on an unmoved way:

1. **Angle test** — "Is the unmoved way nearly straight (≈180°) at this junction?" → uses `nodeOriginalLocal(prev/next)` (pre-move positions). Rationale: when a moved way connects to the unmoved way at _more than one_ shared endpoint (e.g. a U-shaped driveway), the "neighbouring" node on the unmoved way may itself be one of those shared endpoints — which has already shifted by the delta. Using its post-move position distorts the angle reading and can push a straight junction outside the ±5° window, triggering a bogus insertion. Original (pre-move) positions always reflect the unmoved way's actual geometry.

2. **Path-length comparison** — "Which insertion order produces the shorter path?" → uses `nodeLocal(prev/next)` (current positions). Rationale: this is about the way's resulting geometry after insertion, so it should reason about where nodes are now.

`nodeOriginalLocal(node)` returns `_cache.startLocal[node.id] ?? nodeLocal(node)` — for unmoved nodes the two are identical.

## World-coordinate refactor for actions

`actionMove` (and all the geometry-manipulation actions: rotate, reflect, scale, orthogonalize, circularize, straighten-nodes) now do all computation in **world coordinates with a local origin** for floating-point stability. The pattern:
- Pick an origin (e.g. centroid of selected nodes in world space) and store it in `_cache.origin`.
- Store each node's pre-move world position as `startLocal = worldPos - origin`.
- Do all geometry math in local world space (small numbers, FP-stable).
- At the end: `node.move(projWorldToWgs84(localPos + origin))`.

Call sites pass a **world-space delta** (a `Vec2` difference of two `projWgs84ToWorld()` results), not a screen/viewport delta. This removes the `viewport` parameter that was previously required.

- **`NsiTreeProperties` removed from imports** — NSI v7 exports this type but we use `NsiTreesJSON['trees']` directly for the `trees` cache property, making the standalone type import unused.
- **`tags.wikipedia` qids lookup was dead code** — NSI used to cache both `wikidata QID → canonical QID` and `wikipedia URL → wikidata QID` in the replacements data. When we upgraded to NSI v7, which dropped wikipedia tracking, we removed the wp-caching loop in `_loadNsiDataAsync`. This made `this._nsi.qids?.get(tags.wikipedia)` in `upgradeTags` always return `undefined`. Removed the dead branch; `delete newTags.wikipedia` further down remains valid (strips bare `wikipedia=*` when a wikidata match is found).
- **Local `NsiItem` extends upstream `NsiItem`** — NSI v7's `NsiItem` type doesn't include runtime-populated fields `tkv` (tree/key/value path) and `mainTag` (e.g. `brand:wikidata`). We extend it locally to type those fields without casting everywhere.

## StyleSystem / StyleSelector

- **`weight` replaces auto-computed `specificity`** — The old specificity scoring (geometry +50, each tag matcher +10) couldn't express "building always overrides amenity" because both had 1 tag condition = same score. Adding more tag matchers to artificially increase specificity was fragile. `weight` gives the data author explicit control over cascade order, consistent with how presets use `matchScore`.
- **Default weight is 1** — Existing selectors with no `weight` all get weight=1, meaning equal-weight selectors preserve insertion order (stable sort). This keeps current behavior for the vast majority of selectors that don't need explicit ordering.
- **Sort ascending, iterate forward** — `findAll()` returns selectors sorted by weight ascending. `styleMatch()` iterates forward with `deepMerge`, so the last (highest-weight) selector wins. This is simpler than the old pattern of sorting descending then iterating in reverse.

## NetworkSystem

- **`RequestID` as a typed string ID** — Follows the established pattern in `ids.ts` (like `EntityID`, `TileID`). Used throughout `NetworkFetchOptions`, `InflightRequest`, `QueuedFetch`, and all public API methods. Default requestID is `'${METHOD} ${url}'` (e.g. `'GET https://example.com/data'`). Services pass domain-specific IDs like `'keepright-tile-0,0,14'`.
- **Regex `.test()` for `abortMatching` predicates** — All predicates use `/^prefix-/.test(requestID)` instead of `requestID.startsWith('prefix-')`. ~10% faster per jsbench, and consistent across all services. Domain dots escaped (e.g. `/nominatim\.openstreetmap\.org/`).
- **Worker offloading is transparent** — `network.fetch<T>()` automatically routes through `dispatch('fetchAndParse', ...)` when WorkerSystem is available and no custom `fetchFn` is provided. Callers don't know or care whether the fetch ran on main thread or worker. `fetchRaw()` always runs on main thread (returns `Response` object, not serializable).
- **Listener registry for domain-specific worker functions** — `WorkerSystem` has a `registerListener(listenerID, listener)` / `getListener(listenerID)` API. Systems register their `*.worker.ts` listeners at init time. Callers pass `listenerID` + `listenerData` in `NetworkFetchOptions`. If a `listenerID` is provided but not registered, the promise rejects — never silently falls through to generic fetch+parse.
- **Concurrency limiting with FIFO queue** — When `numActive >= maxInflight`, new requests queue. Queued requests are abortable for free (no network request started). Default `maxInflight: 100`.
- **`hasMatching()` checks `_inflight` only, not `_queue` separately** — All requests (both active and queued) are registered in `_inflight` at the bottom of `_trackAndDispatch`. The queue is a *subset* of inflight.
- **Note tile request IDs use `osm-note-tile-` prefix** — Avoids collision with `osm-note-post-create-*` / `osm-note-post-update-*`, so `abortMatching` can simply test `/^osm-note-tile-/`.
- **OsmService request ID prefix conventions** — `osm-data-tile-${tileID}` (map data tiles), `osm-note-tile-${tileID}` (note tiles), `osm-note-post-create-${noteID}`, `osm-note-post-update-${noteID}`, `osm-changeset-create` / `osm-changeset-upload-${id}` / `osm-changeset-close-${id}`.
- **WaybackService metadata cache key is NOT a requestID** — `getMetadataAsync()` has `const key = \`${tile.id}_${releaseDate}\`` which is a local cache lookup key. Only the property passed to `network.fetch()` uses the `requestID` name.

## NetworkSystem — FetchEnvelope and outcome tracking

- **`FetchEnvelope<T>` as the worker-boundary transport type** — Workers can't post `Response` objects, and thrown errors lose `.status` when flattened to string by `worker.postMessage`. `FetchEnvelope` carries the real HTTP status in all cases. All worker listeners return envelopes; the main-thread fetch path produces one too via `fetchEnvelope()` in `util/fetch_response.ts`. The bespoke `OsmFetchResult` is gone — replaced by the generic envelope.
- **AbortError never wrapped in an envelope** — It remains a rejected promise from all paths. This is what allows aborted requests to remain unrecorded (retryable). Never record an abort — the "pan away, pan back reloads the tile" behaviour depends on this invariant.
- **Three public fetch methods for different caller needs** — `fetch<T>()` unwraps the envelope and throws `FetchError` on HTTP error (90% case). `fetchEnvelope<T>()` returns the envelope, letting callers branch on status without try/catch (OsmService auth/rate-limit logic). `fetchRaw()` returns the raw `Response` — always main-thread, always `ok:true` from the envelope's perspective (caller inspects `response.status` itself).
- **`_completed: Map<RequestID, number>` is protected** — NetworkSystem is the single writer. Services use the public API: `isCompleted`, `getStatus`, `markCompleted`, `forget`. `completed.add(id)` was the old pattern that leaked across services; now there's no public write path.
- **Only explicit `requestID` options are recorded** — Auto-computed IDs (`'GET https://...'`) are NOT tracked. `_trackAndDispatch` takes a `trackCompleted: boolean` param; `_getOrDispatch` and `fetchRaw` compute `track = (options?.requestID !== undefined)`. Keeps the map lean and scoped to callers that care about dedup/retry.
- **`STATUS_SKIPPED = -1` for non-HTTP completions** — Tiles that cover a blocked region call `network.markCompleted(requestID)` (status = `STATUS_SKIPPED`). `STATUS_ERROR = 0` is the sentinel for transport failures / worker-flattened errors where no real HTTP status is available.
- **Retry intent is per-service, expressed via `forget()`** — Default is "don't retry" (NetworkSystem auto-records the error status). Do-retry services (Streetside, MapWithAI, OsmService tiles) call `network.forget(requestID)` in their catch handler to un-record the error and allow another attempt on the next `loadTiles()` call.
- **`FetchError` extended to construct from envelope fields** — `new FetchError(Response | FetchErrorInit)`. `FetchErrorInit` carries `{ status, statusText, message?, body? }`. Allows HTTP error details to be reconstructed on the main thread from an error envelope that crossed the worker boundary.

## 3-System Split: SchedulerSystem / WorkerSystem / NetworkSystem

- **WorkerSystem owns "where to run"** — Worker pool (lazy spawn, round-robin, workerURL config, maxWorkers, terminateWorkers) + listener registry (registerListener, unregisterListener, getListener). Extracted from SchedulerSystem (pool) and NetworkSystem (listener registry) to avoid a 1000+ line monolith and give worker management a clear home.
- **SchedulerSystem owns "when to run"** — Game loop (rAF), priority queues (urgent/normal/idle), timers (debounce/throttle/setTimeout/setInterval), frame callbacks, backpressure. No worker knowledge.
- **NetworkSystem owns network I/O** — Fetch lifecycle, inflight tracking, dedup, abort, concurrency limiting, timeout. Dispatches to WorkerSystem when available (`worker` is an optional dependency). Falls back to main-thread listener via `worker.getListener()`.
- **`workerURL` auto-detected in WorkerSystem constructor** — `Context.scriptURL` (captured from `document.currentScript.src` at bundle eval time) is used to derive the worker URL (same directory, matching `.min.` status). Detection happens at construction time (during `prepareAsync`'s system construction loop), so host apps can override or set `null` at any time before workers are first spawned.

## Request Interceptor API

- **Interceptors run on the main thread before dispatch** — They produce a serializable `RequestInit` that can be sent to a web worker. Auth headers are added on the main thread (where the token is available), then the modified init crosses the worker boundary as plain data.
- **Registration order matters** — Interceptors run in registration order, each receiving the output of the previous.
- **OsmService `_authInterceptor`** — Uses `oauth.getAccessToken()` from osm-auth v3.2.0. Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to any request targeting `this._apiroot`.
- **Interceptors replace `fetchFn` for auth** — OsmService no longer passes `fetchFn: this._oauth.fetch`. `fetchFn` remains in the API as an escape hatch.
- **Write operations stay `mainThread: true`** — Changeset create/upload/close and note post operations are infrequent and don't benefit from worker offloading.

## Worker Architecture Vision

- **Deferred result resolution via `resultPriority`** — `WorkerSystem.dispatch()` accepts an optional `{ resultPriority: 'urgent' | 'normal' | 'idle' }`. When set, the promise returned by `dispatch()` is resolved through `SchedulerSystem.schedule()` instead of immediately in the worker's `onmessage` handler. Prevents heavy `.then()` chains from blowing frame budgets. OsmService's `loadFromAPI` uses `resultPriority: 'normal'`.
- **Named operation registry** — Workers support multiple named listeners. Each `*.worker.ts` companion file exports a `ListenerRegistry`. Can't send closures across `postMessage`.
- **All worker listeners return `FetchEnvelope<T>`** — This is the protocol. A listener that throws on HTTP error would have its error flattened to a string by `worker.postMessage`. The envelope is how status survives the boundary.

## Relative URL Resolution in Workers

- **Workers resolve relative URLs against their own script path** — A worker at `js/rapid-worker.js` resolves `data/foo.json` as `js/data/foo.json`, not from the page root.
- **Fix in `NetworkSystem._dispatchFetch`** — When `useWorker` is true, relative URLs are resolved to absolute via `new URL(url, globalThis.location?.href)` before being sent. `_resolveURL` is a private helper.

## Worker Companion Convention (`*.worker.ts`)

- **Co-located companion files** — Worker-side listeners live in `Foo.worker.ts` next to the main-thread `Foo.ts`. Each exports individual named listeners plus a `listeners: ListenerRegistry`.
- **Dual registration** — The same listener functions are registered in two places: (1) the worker imports them via `index.worker.ts` barrel → `worker.ts`, and (2) the service imports them and calls `worker.registerListener()` at init time. Each execution context gets its own module-scope state.
- **Folder-level `index.worker.ts` barrels** — Each module folder with worker companions has an `index.worker.ts` that re-exports them alongside the main-thread `index.ts` barrel.
- **Worker-safe by construction** — `.worker.ts` files must only import worker-safe code (parsers, utilities). They cannot import `Context`, systems, or anything DOM-dependent.
- **`Listener` and `ListenerRegistry` types** in `global.d.ts` — `Listener = (data: unknown, signal: AbortSignal) => unknown | Promise<unknown>`. Declared globally for convenience since they're used across bundle boundaries (worker entry point, companion files, main-thread systems). Avoids cross-bundle import concerns. `ListenerRegistry = Record<ListenerID, Listener>` is the barrel export type for `index.worker.ts` files.
- **Long-lived instances** — Companion files may instantiate stateful objects (e.g. `OsmXMLParser`) at module scope. These persist for the lifetime of their execution context (worker or main thread). A `'service:reset'` listener clears accumulated state (e.g. `_seen` caches) when needed.
- **NetworkSystem owns inflight tracking** — Services pass `task` + `taskData` in `NetworkFetchOptions`. NetworkSystem routes to worker or calls the registered listener directly. No local `inflight` Map needed in services — `isInflight()`, `abortMatching()`, and `hasMatching()` all work transparently.
- **Structured-clone constraint** — Worker task results must be structured-clone safe: plain objects, arrays, Sets, Maps, typed arrays. No DOM nodes, no prototype methods. Parse XML in the worker, return `ParserResult` (not `Document`).
- **`resetAsync` does not terminate workers** — Workers are long-lived and persist across resets. Each system dispatches its own reset message to its listener functions (e.g. `'network:reset'`). Terminating workers on reset would race with reset messages and is expensive (script re-parse + re-compile on respawn). Workers only terminate on explicit `terminateWorkers()` calls or system destruction.

## Architecture

- **Scoped data, no aggregate caches** — Both StyleSystem and SchemaSystem store data in `_scopes: Map<ScopeID, ScopeData>`. No aggregate maps across scopes. Callers access scope data directly: `schema.getScope('osm')?.fields.get(id)`.
- **`'*'` common scope** — Holds geometry fallback presets and default styles. Created by `resetAll()`. Always available even without loaded data. Production `rapid_style.json5` uses `scope: '*'`.
- **Scoped format only** — `merge()` only accepts `{ scopes: [{ scope: 'osm', ... }] }`. External flat data (id-tagging-schema, NsiService) gets wrapped before merging.

- **`TreeStore` owns all nested-tree logic** — `modules/lib/TreeStore.ts` is the single home for path access + flat-key (de)serialization; `modules/util/keypath.ts` was folded in and deleted. `SettingsSystem` (persistence: `rapid.settings.*` namespace + migrations) and `LocalizationSystem` (`_store`, keyed `[locale][resource][…]`) both build on it. Nested internal repr chosen because reads are hot and writes rare.
- **`peek` vs `get`** — `TreeStore.peek` returns a copy-free live reference for hot read paths (l10n `t()`); `get` returns a deep copy of composites for safe external use. Strings are returned as-is by both (immutable, no clone).
- **`<TX_DOT>` normalized at load, not resolve** — Transifex can't use dots in translation keys, so data files use a `<TX_DOT>` sentinel. `LocalizationSystem` rewrites those keys to literal dots once when loading each resource; producers (e.g. `ImagerySource`) percent-encode dots as `%2E` (`encodeURIComponent` leaves `.` alone). The resolver stays ignorant of both encodings.

## Rulesets & Variables

- **Separate `osm_rulesets.json5`** — Not inside `rapid_schema.json5`. Load order: id_tagging_schema → osm_rulesets → rapid_schema.
- **Lookup tables stay as Records** — `areaKeys`/`pointTags`/`vertexTags` are O(1) Record lookups on SchemaScope. Rulesets would be 50-150x slower on these hot paths.
- **`lifecycle` ruleset as config container** — The Set of prefixes is derived from its key patterns, not used for `match()` directly. `lifecycle_prefixes` variable is the canonical source.
- **`match()` and excludes subtlety** — `match({k: v})` only sees the key/value pairs you pass. When excludes reference different keys than includes, pass the full tag object.
- **Actions access schema via `graph.context.systems.schema`** — `Graph.context` is always set. This is fine and explicit.

## MVT Protobuf Parsing on Worker

- **`network:fetchAndParseMVT` as a standard listener** — Generic enough for any MVT tile source. Accepts `{ url, init, tileXYZ }`, fetches URL via `fetchAndParse` (reusing the existing generic listener internally), decodes with `VectorTile`/`Protobuf`, converts each feature to GeoJSON, returns `MVTFeatureResult[]` with `layerID`, `origID`, and `feature`. The caller decides what to do with each layer.
- **Both services converge** — VectorTileService (standard MVT path) and MapillaryService both use the same listener. Layer-specific logic (caching images vs. creating GeoJSONData with merge queues) stays on the main thread where it needs `Context`.
- **VectorTileService split: `_parseTileBuffer` vs `_processVTResults`** — PMTiles path still decodes on the main thread via `_parseTileBuffer` (which builds `MVTFeatureResult[]` from a raw buffer), then delegates to `_processVTResults`. Standard MVT path receives pre-parsed `MVTFeatureResult[]` directly from the worker. Both paths share `_processVTResults` for property stringification, prophash computation, multi→single splitting, GeoJSONData creation, caching, and merge queue logic.
- **No buffer-accepting variant (yet)** — The listener only accepts a URL, not a pre-fetched `ArrayBuffer`. The PMTiles path would need this (PMTiles owns its own fetch, then hands us a buffer to decode). Deferred until we think through PMTiles lifecycle on the worker.

## PMTiles Fetching Bypasses NetworkSystem

- **PMTiles library owns its own fetch** — `PMTiles.getZxy()` delegates to `Source.getBytes(offset, length, signal)` internally. The default `FetchSource` issues HTTP Range requests with `globalThis.fetch`. These requests bypass NetworkSystem entirely, so `inflightPMTiles: Map<string, AbortController>` tracks them separately on VTSource.
- **Future unification** — A custom PMTiles `Source` adapter could delegate `getBytes()` to `network.fetchRaw()` with Range headers. This would eliminate `inflightPMTiles` and let NetworkSystem be the single source of truth for all inflight traffic. Low priority for now.

## Generic Type Parameters Over Element Casts

- **Annotate the container, not elements** — `new Set<RequestID>(...)` over `new Set(... as RequestID)`. One annotation vs. repeated casts. Already the pattern for `SystemID`; now applied consistently to `RequestID` and other ID types in Set/Map constructors.

## Dual-Props Pattern

Used when a class resolves references (`var()`, locale strings) in its props:
- `props` = raw/immutable (never mutated after construction)
- `_resolved` / `_resolvedValue` = lazy resolved copy
- Getter returns `resolved ?? raw` (zero overhead when no vars)
- `reset()` = null out the resolved copy
- Applied to: `Style`, `PropMatcher`. NOT needed for `Preset`/`Field` (localization cached in `_strings` Map).

## Scheduler Fallback Pattern

- **Services must fall through when scheduler is absent** — `scheduler?.debounce('id', request, opts)` silently drops the `request()` when scheduler is undefined. For services where the wrapped function MUST execute (API calls, data fetches), use: `if (shouldDebounce && scheduler) { scheduler.debounce(...) } else { request() }`. UI render deferrals (`redraws`, `renders`) are safe as no-ops — missing one is harmless.
- **`scheduler` is an optional dependency** — Services that use it add `'scheduler'` to `optionalDependencies`. This keeps services testable without SchedulerSystem and supports future CLI contexts.

## Context Lifecycle

- **No backward compat for old `initAsync()`** — It now only inits (doesn't start). Simple consumers use `context.run()`. v3 breaking change.
- **`prepareAsync()` → `initAsync()` → `startAsync()`** — Each phase chains the previous. All idempotent. `run()` is a convenience that chains everything.

## Pixi Labels and Atlas Textures

- **Measure labels during render, rasterize after render** — `PixiLayerLabels` uses `PIXI.CanvasTextMetrics.measureText()` for placement math inside `render()`, then queues texture creation through `SchedulerSystem.schedule()` so `renderer.generateTexture()` runs in the scheduler drain phase after all frame callbacks complete. This fixes Pixi v8 renderer re-entry corruption while preserving the existing Pixi.Text rasterizer for now.
- **Labels are managed features, placement data is not** — `PixiLayerLabels` owns RBush placement and stores `LabelProps` placeholders. `PixiFeatureLabel` is created lazily only for visible placeholders and owns the actual `Sprite` / `BitmapText` / `MeshRope` display object. Off-screen culling destroys display objects without losing placement records.
- **Atlas items store uploadable sources, not just ImageData** — `AtlasAllocator` accepts `ImageData`, `HTMLCanvasElement`, `HTMLImageElement`, and `ImageBitmap`. WebGL uploads use the 7-arg `texSubImage2D` DOM-source overload, WebGPU uses `copyExternalImageToTexture`, and the canvas renderer blits the same source into its backing canvas. This avoids the previous `drawImage` → `getImageData` readback for images, bitmaps, and canvases.
- **Tile-only edge replication** — The atlas still reserves a 1px ring around every texture frame, but only tile imagery needs that ring filled with edge-replicated pixels to prevent seams under bilinear sampling. `PixiTextures._fromEdgePaddedCanvas()` builds a `(w+2) x (h+2)` source for tile atlas entries with two `drawImage` passes. Symbol/text/icon entries upload at the inner frame position and leave the reserved ring transparent.

## Canvas Renderer Atlas Support

- **Canvas renderer bypasses the upload pipeline** — Pixi's canvas renderer has no `_uploads` map. It reads `TextureSource.resource` directly via `canvasUtils.getCanvasSource()` at draw time. If `resource` is falsy, it returns `null` and nothing draws.
- **Canvas-backed `AtlasSource` as the fix** — When `useCanvas: true`, `AtlasSource` creates an `HTMLCanvasElement` matching the slab size and sets it as `this.resource`. The canvas renderer's `getCanvasSource()` returns this directly — zero copies, zero conversions (not PMA, no resize needed).
- **Blit direct sources at allocation time, not upload time** — Because there's no upload hook for canvas, `_blitItemToCanvas()` is called in `AtlasAllocator.allocate()` right after the item is added. It uses `putImageData()` for `ImageData` and `drawImage()` for canvas/image/bitmap sources, with the same padded-vs-inner offset used by GL/GPU.
- **No JS padded-pixel buffer** — The old `_getItemPixels()` loop is gone. Edge replication happens only when `PixiTextures` builds a padded tile canvas; other atlas entries upload directly and leave their reserved ring transparent.
- **Canvas overhead only when needed** — The `useCanvas` option is only set to `true` when `RendererType.CANVAS` is detected. GL/GPU paths don't create backing canvases, avoiding the extra ~16MB per 2048×2048 slab.
- **`(this as any).resource = canvas`** — Type mismatch: `AtlasSource extends TextureSource<BufferSourceOptions>` where the generic expects a TypedArray resource, but the canvas renderer needs an `HTMLCanvasElement`. The `as any` cast is intentional — the canvas renderer inspects `resource` dynamically, not via generic type constraints.
- **No clear-on-free** — Freed atlas regions aren't cleared on the backing canvas, matching the GL/GPU behavior (they overwrite freed space with `texSubImage2D` / `copyExternalImageToTexture` when it is reallocated).

## Style Resolution

- **Fallback cascading is selective** — `fill.color` ← `base.color` or `stroke.color`; `marker.color` ← `base.color` only; etc. Not uniform `base.color` on everything.
- **Single `styleDefaults`** — Defined once in `Style.ts`, not duplicated per PixiFeature class.
- **Rendering code starts with `styleMatch()`** — Don't construct marker/style objects with hardcoded values. Apply specific overrides after `styleMatch(tags, geometry)`.
